61.572783458508425	63.26	O2	Professor Cohen welcome to in conversation.
63.56481200258669	64	O1	Hi.
64.62000000000002	65.2	O1	Yeah.
65.71007519896534	69.25007519896533	O2	Are we sliding into a recession maybe even a depression.
69.43729320284534	71.98	O1	I certainly don't see depression.
72.24000000000001	78.99418419018531	O1	It's a Christian no one ever does ah nobody ever successfully forecasts even recessions.
79.00170298992664	83.93729320284535	O1	But um right now it doesn't look we we might have a technical recession in Europe.
84.33729320284534	91.60262251821287	O1	We have at most a slowdown in the US and in China both um you know growth we're still growing but more slowly.
91.70262251821286	99.51382573815685	O1	Um, but it's clearly there's there's certainly problems whatever optimist you may have had about, you know, near-term global growth.
99.9724725223781	108.92	O1	At a year ago is not looking very good right now, we're clearly looking at at some part growth and going on right now and probably slower and in the next few quarters.
109.17488720155201	116.48	O2	The impression you get from the headlines is that this is due to the trade war between US and China and the various spillover effects, but is it.
116.66000000000001	125.04	O1	I think that's a very large part of it, I mean, part of what's happening is simply that we had one stimulus policy which was the US tax cut.
125.4	130.96	O1	Which wasn't very stimulative but did give a boost but that's behind us so whatever stimulus we got is in the rear view mirror.
131.3673684018107	138.0977948490386	O1	But the trade war is having clearly having a chilling effect, it's having a chilling effect on business investment.
138.0977948490386	142.96	O2	But by that argument, uh if there was a different president in the White House,
143.3	149.28409475638517	O2	Then all of this would go away and we would go back to sort of say happy trajectory of you know global growth.
149.28409475638517	153.9	O1	Well, the trade war is not the only problem and you would not have.
154.62481200258668	159.76	O1	You know the a at the a a different US president is not going to be
160.34	167.9	O1	Like Trump not going to make policy by tweet it's not going to just uh ah declare that that we need to block imports of steel from Canada.
168.07242424150257	175.67242424150257	O1	Protect national security you know they they have crazy stuff um but on the other hand, uh I'm not sure that even if a democrat wins.[N]
175.82000000000002	183.3	O1	Uh, next year that that she or he is going to be in a rush to roll back the clock.
183.62	186.98000000000002	O1	So it's it's it it'd be a less unstable environment.
186.98000000000005	195.79885194635438	O1	But you know uh imagine yourself are you're gonna want to be the person who ah takes off a bunch of tariffs on China,
195.79885194635438	200.15069610743888	O1	sees a surge of imports from China and then gets blamed for the loss of jobs.
200.15069610743888	205.85488647035783	O1	I I in some ways it's gonna be very hard to undo uh the damage that's been done already.
215.9483645941663	223.03862611602918	O2	But if you did have a removal of the Terrace or at least a return to the way that Harris were prior to all of this,[N]
223.4462018745266	228.46	O2	then surely we would say no in fact the American economy would do better.
228.68	231.24	O1	It would some extent but the trouble is
232.6981955904293	235.3299248010346	O1	I think it's kind of a loss of innocence that's taken place.
235.46	238.00844286573113	O2	[OVERLAP/]It's a very n-[/OVERLAP] non-economic term.
238.00844286573113	243.66	O1	Well but I mean this in [OVERLAP/]uh I actually[/OVERLAP] have ah have a real sense if you had asked me.
244.50781959560265	248.06	O1	What kind of what how did the world trading system work?
248.74240600129332	253.62051722300072	O1	I would have said that you know the one most important thing about it was not just the tariffs were pretty low.
253.97657787238046	258.3	O1	But that there were rules. That countries couldn't
259.65999999999997	269.25393938103576	O1	Just arbitrarily slap on tariffs you wouldn't just have ah I'm a leader of a major economy say I don't like uh China so I'm gonna put tariffs on
269.25393938103576	275.81882734228884	O1	And I and never mind the justification or you know I'll uh uh whatever it is I'll just call it and a national security threat.
276.20228612909676	284.44	O1	Uh, the that was clearly that was understood to be not the the rules of the game said you weren't weren't supposed to do that now we've just seen it happen.
284.74	290.32	O1	And that without any Drastic consequences without ah legal challenges um.
290.887669197672	294.24	O1	The that can't be undone from now on everyone will know.
294.58	303.5623466487695	O1	That major economy leaders are capable of finding loopholes and in the trade law, um that allow them to slap on tariffs.
303.5623466487695	310.36	O1	That it's uh that that the the uh assurances that of of a stable trading environment.
310.58	316.4211683142015	O1	That we thought were guaranteed by international agreements really were pretty hollow, and that's not coming back.
316.4211683142015	325.8	O2	Let's say for example that China gets together with India and together with the EU and brings this all to the WTO and says.
326.8	332.2925321994309	O2	America cannot unilaterally slap on tariffs, [OVERLAP/]is [/OVERLAP]that the solution?
332.30010795792833	342.0875757584974	O1	WTO has an appellate body and it's i- it's uh I I think it hasn't quite yet, but when uh very shortly there will no longer be a core.
342.21999999999997	348.22	O1	So the WTO won't even be able to make rulings, and then also how many taxs does the WTO have right have more but,
348.47999999999996	355.72	O1	What I I think what we've always relied upon is that that the key players considered.
355.84721800387996	359.59496816796116	O1	maintaining the system important enough that they did not defy.
359.59496816796116	360.8004726030508	O2	So was self-restraint.
360.8004726030508	366.5373168056869	O1	Yes it was ah it was self-restraint based on the belief that it wasn't everybody's interest to have a functioning system.
366.5373168056869	370.32	O1	We've now seen that United States no longer.
371.06	376.42	O1	Plays by those rules it's not clear that China ever really did play by those rules so,
377.76	385.6	O1	Does it matter, but if if the WTO is even capable of making rulings anymore, ah what happens if countries just say,
386.57217819668443	387.80005695875616	O1	S- says you you know.
387.91999999999996	396.65010976972025	O1	But then that is not just a breakdown of things like the World Trade Organization isn't that also just a breakdown of our entire global system from the United Nations to anything else?
396.67266616894415	401.86	O2	where we we agree not by the United Nations enforcing it with tanks.
402.3217612451826	406.7768828175477	O2	But rather by some form of self-restraint and uh generalized agreement.
406.7768828175477	411.62	O1	[OVERLAP/]Yes[/OVERLAP] although trade is uh is fairly unique I mean we have international.
412.52	417.007669197672	O1	Mean we have things like NATO or whatever international defense alliances for the most part.
417.3372727245076	422.3874642043111	O1	Um we don't the the reason we don't have a whole lot of wars right now is not that the UN stops them.
422.6293758474243	427.9903023668214	O1	It's that that most countries have figured out that wars are actually a really bad business, it's not worth it. Uh.
428.3009084652166	432.85353398577314	O1	But the uh the trading system is is unique in that it really is a set of agree you know.
432.96872198318636	438.34000000000003	O1	We have global agreements that have actually been effective and have really restrained even powerful countries,
438.84	444.35689412846955	O1	And that's an era that may have come to an end, quite abruptly just the last couple of years.
444.35689412846955	449.18	O2	So everybody's going to do every country is going to do things which are completely self-interested.
449.56	457.5852858043102	O2	And that it's going to be strongly politically motivated perhaps it always was, but it's now going to be ostensibly. So it's that what [OVERLAP/]you're saying.[/OVERLAP]
457.63831617462336	461.28878789445656	O1	The trading global trading system it's really it's not about national interest.
461.28878789445656	469.1990976124161	O1	I mean national interest is is usually best served by free trade but there are special interests within each country you now get to a situation where
469.46751879974124	476.68858475522876	O1	Special interest groups again ah ah can can lobby ah or where just the and the whims of of global leaders
476.68858475522876	480.2584848604668	O1	and that I don't think that the now that we've seen that that can happen
480.7	486.46000000000004	O1	Um that even if we get a much more restrained set of you know set of leaders in the world even if even if we have ah[N]
486.6924242415026	491.7178787316561	O1	A very old style trade policy.
492.48212120751276	502.2616967832527	O1	Um talk from the next U.S. president the fact of the matter is people now know that ah system that we thought we had was was always much more uh huh Fragile.
502.2616967832527	503.1821212075129	O1	than people thought it was.
503.60315799094667	507.18	O2	President Trump would argue that the trade war has been brilliant for America.[N]
539.692330802328	544.8000000000001	O2	Let me play the devil's advocate president Trump would argue that the trade war has been brilliant for America.[N]
545.1999999999999	551.16	O2	Um, unemployment is at still historic lows GDP is looking perfectly healthy.[N]
551.4124812002588	559.96	O2	Um, he'd say America's doing wonderfully out of this and even the world might be doing wonderfully out of, China has been forced to open up.
560.3078195956024	565.441348640941	O2	Ah it's being forced to play more by the global rules in fact he would argue.
565.441348640941	569.8049624005174	O1	Except that in fact right now GDP growth actually is kind of subpar we think.
570.14	574.1800000000001	O1	Meaning we ah it's the fiscal statistics are lagging but
574.52	579.0800000000002	O1	But we tracking estimate suggests that we're um two percent.
579.22	585.5950214225967	O1	Which is not not very good trade deficit has not come down at all manufacturing is contracting in the United States.
585.5950214225967	592.12	O1	So this is not this is not what we are promised for a trade war and when you bear in mind United States has enormous fiscal stimulus
592.2324812002586	593.86	O2	But people still have jobs.[N]
594	601.1800000000001	O1	Well if you're willing to run up. The deficit ah the the federal um um ah federal deficit to
601.5399999999998	608.92	O1	We're now running deficits about um comparable. As a share of GDP to what they were when we had eight percent unemployment.
609.18	617.5600000000001	O1	If you're so if you're willing to do lots of fiscal stimulus and just pay no attention to all of that fiscal responsibility stuff that people were talking about uh five years ago.
617.86	623.34	O1	Um that's not that hard but considering Um that's. We're not getting very much of a payoff.
623.54	629.38	O1	Ah so uh I I think the Um it it is true unemployment is low.
629.52	635.86	O1	Ah we have a ti- tight labor market ah but everything we know says that that's in spite of the trade war not because of it.
635.98	640.42	O2	So you're saying that in the end america will have to pay the price for this at some point.
640.68	643.4200000000001	O1	Yeah I mean we you can see a business investment.
643.4875757584975	651.0075757584975	O1	Ah capex has really um really seems to be ah in a decline consumer spending remains strong but uh consumer confident.
651.06	657.12	O1	It's just falling of the cliff so maybe that doesn't really translate into lower spending but people are are aware I mean.
657.26	660.82	O1	We're ganna uh allow those tariffs are gonna hit you know in the next.
661.18	670.1	O1	Yeah actually right now friends are telling me that Walmart has gotten a whole lot more expensive just just all of a sudden and I think the most important thing from my point of view is it's not how does this end.
671.0578787924871	675.38	O1	Is there any plausible set of Chinese policies that would satisfy Donald Trump.
676.42	680.72	O1	That's hard I think the Chinese ah actually they've been pretty vocal about that saying that
680.9	684.929233020839	O1	We don't know what what the Americans want we we don't know what what it is we could do.
684.929233020839	686.04	O2	[OVERLAP/]And do you agree with them?[/OVERLAP]
686.3199999999999	689.38	O1	I agree with them they ah the there are real issues.
689.68	694.570711305834	O1	Um intellectual property industrial policy that amounts to defact violation of the trade rules.
694.7707113058341	702.6400000000001	O1	Those are real issues but not an all clear that that's what ah the US has not formulated any demands that I understand.
703.26	707.8000000000003	O1	And uh I don't think it's formulating any demands I mean I I think the.
707.950866059837	715.2995301251033	O1	And the bilateral trade imbalance but that's ah yeah that's not actually even something that that even the Chinese government has the power to do.
725.230909101969	731.7206299667573	O2	Let's move to look at what all of this means for us. Here in Asia. How is this going to impact us.[N]
731.756850166214	737.44	O1	I think ah it means at at the moment it looks like it is a problem, it certainly uh,[N]
738.28	745.4200000000001	O1	Uh the US is now putting thing quite high tariffs on virtually everything. In China. Exports in many cases.
745.64	751.7	O1	Ah there is no real alternative ah so people will continue to buy stuff from China.
752.1	758.6	O1	Um but some of it will shift we can already see that there's substantial shifting ah to uh,
759.02	763.46	O1	To s- smaller Asian economies and some of this is things that were already happening. We already
763.8199999999999	767.7800000000001	O1	Things like the apparel industry were already moving to lower-wage countries like Bangladesh.
768.1924242415025	772.6124242415025	O1	But then there's probably a lot of just plain. People don't end up buying things at all.
773.02	778.866276103422	O1	If you put tariffs on footwear. We're not gonna revive the American footwear and just it's just too far out of.
778.866276103422	779.5663159818931	N	[IVS]
779.6780451924985	784.82	O1	At least not not in any short term probably people just end up buying fewer shoes and that means that
785.22	791.5600000000001	O1	I it's not it it's it's a loss um the export side to ah to Asia as a whole.
792.3875187997413	800.0600000000001	O2	What would some commentators who say that really all of this could benefit at least some of the Asian countries we've mentioned [OVERLAP/]for example[/OVERLAP] yeah Vietnam.
800.18	806.1800000000001	O1	That's right I mean within within limits. The uh the the only problem I think is that they.
806.6524242415026	812.440909132385	O1	China is also a an importer of of goods from these countries and we'll uh they'll they'll lose.
812.4484848908824	819.0600000000001	O1	But I think on um the whole there is for as long as it stays focused on ah a US China axis.[N]
819.4324812002587	825.8093024876505	O1	Then there will be some beneficiaries of trade divers. I mean it's uh you can say the corresponding thing.
826.1643500756064	832.34	O1	Uh US farmers have been dreadfully hurt by the drop off Chinese purchases of foreign goods.
832.54	839.0128772292933	O1	That's been good for uh Brazilian soybean uh growers for uh you know for for Canadian wheat farmers.
839.0128772292933	848.7	O1	Uh so there will be some ah as long as it stays localized now the trouble is that if eventually I think you could already see this kind of happening that is as people start to say
849	853.34	O1	as Trump and and his associates start to say well you know what what good does this do us if we just
853.76	858.2600000000001	O1	Um buy from Vietnam from China then they start just widen the trade war.
858.58	862.0400000000001	O2	But what about a world that is less globalized and in one in which
862.9	869.46	O2	Asia perhaps together with South America and Africa and perhaps to some degree ah Europe,
869.8075187997412	876.58	O2	Ah begin to trade much much more within themselves and in which the US is decoupled from that system
876.7249624005174	881.7249624005174	O1	Yeah ah you can think of that as kind of a belt and road world, right, they ah where where it really it
882.2100751989652	887.4900751989653	O1	There's uh Eurasia becomes ah and maybe south America as well but uh comes a trade.
887.78	892.9652583263011	O1	I mean to some extent that can work the United States is not the is is still a big part of the world economy,
892.9878147255251	899.08	O1	but not as critical as once it was ah the trouble I think is that we a lot of us believe
899.7	906.0600000000001	O1	That these global value chains have been important beyond the direct cost savings,
906.4	913.0400000000001	O1	That that um the this intermeshing of industry has been really important at generating international
913.1724812002585	917.0324812002585	O1	Transfer of technology of ideas that best practices spread
917.4150375994825	923.2950375994825	O1	Um that it's really ah been an important factor in Asian development that um
924.290225596896	933.7	O1	That Asia has been and American uh as well but certainly the Asia is part of ah of a network that spans the whole globe and so the ah good ideas.
933.9399999999999	938.74	O1	Developed anywhere quickly get ah adopted um everywhere.
939.0399999999998	946.3199999999999	O1	And once you start to fragment that then maybe we're looking at g- global productivity was already starting to slow,
946.68	956.3000000000001	O1	Before the trade crisis came along and this can possibly ah caused to slow further which is not obviously not what we want to be seeing uh looking forward
956.48	961.6600000000001	O2	And if you were to give advice to President C about how to tackle President Trump,[N]
961.68	964.1199993960557	O1	I have no idea how to attack the President Trump.[N]
1002.82	1008.5600000000001	O2	Let's look just at the next the next six months to the next two or three years,[N]
1008.9707692191549	1013.32	O2	If you were uh a businessman what would you do?
1013.5553846095773	1019.4300751989654	O1	I'd be cautious, I mean I I don't see a catastrophe looming, uh
1019.7150945582389	1026.5550945582388	O1	Of course. But we of course we never do. Nobody ever sees. Those are uh the only people who successfully predict um major crises
1026.96	1031.7	O1	Uh have also predicted many other crises that didn't happen but everything is suggesting.
1032.2	1036.98	O1	That growth is going to be sluggish that um
1037.6200000000001	1046.34	O1	That sales will not be so good that that um we're we're not looking um at we're looking at weak not necessarily a declining but weak economies.
1046.72	1053.7	O1	Over the next uh who who knows, but um three years from now. But over the next year or two,
1054.0600000000002	1062.56	O1	So that if I were thinking about making commitments about spending on uh uh I would probably hold off wait for some further evidence,
1062.8200000000002	1069.16	O1	Of course the thing is that's a self fulfilling prophecy. If everybody starts to. And that's actually what seems to be happening is everybody is holding off.
1069.38	1074.02	O1	Waiting to see how this all plays out and in so doing are generating the slowdown.
1074.2	1080.12	O1	That makes people even more cautious and I guess if if you wanna tell a story about how how we could get a global recession that's how it happened.
1080.9	1089.4	O2	So that's the iron isn't it? Cause you're saying well be cautious but being cautious means that we're not putting more money into the system. [OVERLAP/]Pump [/OVERLAP]doesn't have that much water.
1089.5775939987068	1090.1370089056154	O1	Well, that's the.
1090.3918961071672	1091.9116070719906	O2	[OVERLAP/]We[/OVERLAP] need to spend don't we?
1091.9642386701798	1095.2798496020694	O1	That's why we have uh Keynesian economics right the whole point being that,
1095.6000000000001	1102.52	O1	That Perfectly rational reasonable individual decisions, ah sometimes add up to a collectively really bad outcome.
1102.88	1105.9	O1	The that uh just I mean two thousand and nine.
1106.0200000000002	1111.14	O1	Everybody was cutting back on spending and the problem is that my spending is your income and your spending is my income and if we all cut back.
1111.6000000000001	1119.74	O1	Same time and we're getting to a little bit of that now, so where it's an order of magnitude less serious now than it was ten years ago so far.
1120.1200000000001	1124.82	O1	But uh it's not it's it's not looking great and uh uh,
1125.0400000000002	1131.34	O1	And this is this is what the particularly the bond mark. Even more than the stock market is telling us the bond market is uh everybody sort of,
1131.5400000000002	1141.14	O1	Looking around saying oh gee uh where is where is the spending gonna come from and that's why you know ten year rates of ah fallen so dramatically since last fall.
1141.44	1146.82	O2	So what should governments in particularly in Asia be doing more infrastructure spending?
1146.9875187997413	1152.7548872015518	O1	If necessary and I think it's quite or more something, I mean in in the long run China has got to wean itself off.
1152.7548872015518	1159.26	O1	It's uh dependence upon uh uh infrastructure spending as the answer for everything it it needs more
1160.0600000000002	1169.1292308563384	O1	The opposite of the US so we need maybe less consumer demand and more uh infrastructure but China needs more consumer demand and and not so much reliance on infrastructure,
1169.1292308563384	1171.6323076952115	O1	but doing what it whatever it takes to avoid a,
1172.8679237415536	1177.16	O1	To avoid a recession ah is almost always the right thing to do and.
1177.4	1183.0773178524028	O1	So yeah ah ah ta- take whatever steps are necessary to keep keep money flowing.
1183.1003947667689	1188.26	O2	And if you were to give advice to President C about how to tackle President Trump,
1188.38	1191.7599999999993	O1	Oh I have no idea how to tackle President Trump I mean,
1191.96	1196.834887201552	O1	When you're dealing with a man who's going to argue about what the weather forecast said how it's supposed to deal with
1197.1230769143663	1205.96	O1	Um um the um but um I I think the I think that my my advice to to see with D two uh uh,
1206.8400000000001	1208.74	O1	Uh be prepared to deal.
1209.5200000000002	1214.02	O1	Uh with ah whatever comes along that you you cannot count.
1214.8200000000002	1219.7	O1	On on reaching a resolution on on the trade war I I in fact I pretty much.
1220.0400000000002	1227.82	O1	Um I would be extremely surprised at the United States. if if Trump doesn't go through with the full range of ah the tariffs he's proposed and then some more
1228.3600000000001	1230.24	O1	Ah so that for the next ah
1230.98	1237.9326315981893	O1	Um bunch of time we have here ah another a for the next eighteen months US trade policy is going to be ah very unfavorable for China.
1238.1000000000001	1247	O1	And China needs to have a contingency plan to sustain its economy in the face of of that US uh uh protectionism
1247.4548872015519	1249.6000000000001	O2	And that means all there are other countries in the world as well.
1249.98	1252.14	O1	Well yes I mean for the moment,
1252.9	1256.38	O1	I mean that the uh I think the the Mexicans are looking and saying
1256.74	1262.5600000000002	O1	Well, uh uh we we ah we seem to be out of the line of fire for now,
1262.8000000000002	1271.3600000000001	O1	But the Europeans maybe not uh yeah the ah the next shoot a drop might be a ah a national security tariff on European auto production.
1271.7	1280.1000000000001	O1	So ah other pra- countries should also ev- everyone everyone I think needs to be prepared to do what it takes their economy rolling.
1280.42	1286.18	O1	Ah even if ah we're ah some uh even if exports were being hit by a trade war.
1286.3200000000002	1289.9277582892964	O2	Ah do whatever they take uh whatever it takes what does that mean?
1289.9277582892964	1292.98	O1	Ah whatever it takes well I what that meant uh
1293.8200000000002	1294.74	O2	[OVERLAP/]Increased[/OVERLAP] deficit.
1295.18	1296.1038376888098	N	[IVS]
1296.1038376888098	1300.6	O1	Yeah it um government debt has been vastly overrated as a risk,
1301.22	1306.18	O1	The risk of inadequate spending is much more serious and look we're in a world of low interest rate.
1306.927692304789	1309.96	O1	Ah and you know where ah.
1310.92	1317.32	O1	Trillions and trillions of dollars of government debt actually has negative and rates and even in the US the um.
1318.2600000000002	1323.78	O1	Uh uh inflation protected. Uh borrowing has approximately zero.
1324.286153828732	1327.989230780845	O1	So it it really doesn't cost anything to borrow so yeah spend.
1328.2630769143664	1332.64	O2	The simple answer but the argument always against that spending in has always been that,
1332.8600000000001	1338.74	O2	Ah the current generation doesn't pay for it but the next generation will and that it would be irresponsible to do that.
1338.8400000000001	1341.8	O1	But that's a fundamental misunderstanding and the end.
1342.3000000000002	1347.2	O1	Ah certainly from the point of view of the world economy as a whole debt is money that we owe to ourselves.
1347.3924812002588	1354.2924812002586	O1	Right it's not like right. It's not a bunch of space aliens as well in the debt. It's it's it's the world as a whole that that owns the debt as well as as owes it.
1354.48	1362.2999999999997	O1	And it's not the reason to worry if you would worry about issuing debt if you either thought there was a serious risk government insolvency.
1362.38	1370.3	O1	Which doesn't appear to be for any major player right now. Or if you thought that government spending was coming at the expense of private spending than it was crowding out,
1370.48	1379.82	O1	Uh private investment. But there is no hint that that's happening either. So no I mean I think the we're nowhere close to a point where the risk is of
1380.1200000000008	1387.6354887932748	O1	Too much spending were governments and and much more life it will suffer from too little and at least in the next few years.
1388.14	1389.92	O2	professor Cohen thank you very much.
1390.0400000000002	1390.6000000000001	O1	Thank you.
